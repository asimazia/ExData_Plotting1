This repository is for coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis course week 1 assignment. The task was to analyze the power consumption of individual house hold.
For this purpose we need to analyze data by generating four graphs that are replication of the original ones provided in the instructions.
The instructions are as follows:

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
Create a separate R code file plot1.R, plot2.R, etc. that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

For this I have uploaded all 4 R code files along with plots in png format.
I have also included explanation of the code that I used so it would be easy to understand.
